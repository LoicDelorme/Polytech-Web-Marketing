            </br>
            <h2>1. Basic FrenchCoin Services.</h2>
            <p><strong>1.1. Eligibility.</strong> To be eligible to use the FrenchCoin Services, you must be at least 18 years old.</p>
            <p>Your eligibility to access certain FrenchCoin Services also depends on the country in which you reside. The list of FrenchCoin Services accessible by country can be found at <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/global">https://www.frenchcoin.fr/global</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2. FrenchCoin Services</strong>. Your FrenchCoin account ("FrenchCoin Account") encompasses the following basic FrenchCoin services: One or more hosted Digital Currency wallets that allow users to store certain supported digital currencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum ("Digital Currency"), and to track, transfer, and manage their supported Digital Currencies (the "Hosted Digital Currency Wallet"); Digital Currency conversion services through which users can buy and sell supported Digital Currencies in transactions with FrenchCoin (the "Conversion Services"); and a Fiat Currency (e.g. GBP, EUR, CAD) account for use in connection with other FrenchCoin Services (a "Currency Wallet") and for eligible users, a Digital Currency exchange platform ("GDAX") (collectively the "FrenchCoin Services"). <strong>The risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currency can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding Digital Currency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</strong></p>
            <h2>2. Creating a FrenchCoin Account.</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1. Registration of FrenchCoin Account.</strong> In order to use any of the FrenchCoin Services, you must first register by providing your name, an e-mail address, password, and affirming your acceptance of this Agreement. FrenchCoin may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a FrenchCoin Account, or limit the number of FrenchCoin Accounts that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2. Identity Verification.</strong> In order to use certain features of the FrenchCoin Services, including certain transfers of Digital Currency and/or government-issued currency ("Fiat Currency"), you may be required to provide FrenchCoin with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number). In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update FrenchCoin if any information changes. <strong>You hereby authorize FrenchCoin to, directly or through third parties make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including to query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth), to query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance), and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.</strong></p>
            <h2>3. Hosted Digital Currency Wallet.</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1. In General.</strong> The Hosted Digital Currency Wallet services allow you to send supported Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store supported Digital Currency from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the FrenchCoin Site (each such transaction is a "Digital Currency Transaction").<strong>FrenchCoin reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction limits FrenchCoin cannot reverse a Digital Currency Transaction which has been broadcast to a Digital Currency network. The Hosted Digital Currency Wallet services are available only in connection with those Digital Currencies that FrenchCoin, in its sole discretion, decides to support. The Digital Currencies that FrenchCoin supports may change from time to time. If you have any questions about which Digital Currencies FrenchCoin currently supports, please visit <a href="https://support.frenchcoin.fr">https://support.frenchcoin.fr</a>. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Hosted Digital Currency Wallet services to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies in any form that are not supported by FrenchCoin. FrenchCoin assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use FrenchCoin Services for digital currencies that FrenchCoin does not support.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>3.2. Digital Currency Transactions.</strong> FrenchCoin processes supported Digital Currency according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to FrenchCoin. In the event you initiate a Digital Currency Transaction by entering the recipient's email address and the recipient does not have an existing FrenchCoin Account, FrenchCoin will email the recipient and invite them to open a FrenchCoin Account. If the designated recipient does not open a FrenchCoin Account within 30 days, FrenchCoin will return the supported Digital Currency associated with the transaction to your FrenchCoin Account. Once submitted to a Digital Currency network, a Digital Currency Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your FrenchCoin Account balance or be available to conduct transactions. FrenchCoin may charge network fees (miner fees) to process a Digital Currency transaction on your behalf. FrenchCoin will calculate the network fee in its discretion, although FrenchCoin will always notify you of the network fee at or before the time you authorize the transaction.</p>
            <p><strong>3.3. Digital Currency Storage &amp; Transmission Delays.</strong> FrenchCoin securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for FrenchCoin to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Currency Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Currency Transaction for 48 hours or more. You acknowledge and agree that a Digital Currency Transaction facilitated by FrenchCoin may be delayed.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4. Third Party Payments.</strong> FrenchCoin has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of FrenchCoin Services). FrenchCoin is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with Digital Currency transferred using the FrenchCoin Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify FrenchCoin Support at <a href="mailto:trust@frenchcoin.fr">trust@frenchcoin.fr</a> so that we may consider what action to take, if any.</p>
            <p><strong>3.5. FrenchCoin Vault</strong>. You may elect to use the FrenchCoin Vault to store supported Digital Currency. The FrenchCoin Vault allows users to set withdrawal time-delays and/or to require the electronic approval of multiple individuals designated by the user before transfers may be completed. FrenchCoin also offers an advanced Vault which allows users the option to view, control, and distribute private keys of associated Digital Currency to multiple third parties whose majority approval will be required to transfer associated Digital Currency (the "Multisig Vault"). <strong>FrenchCoin cannot restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys which are not within FrenchCoin's control. If you use the Multisig Vault you acknowledge that FrenchCoin is not responsible for transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining private keys and/or Digital Currency associated with the Vault.</strong> If you and/or co-signing authorities lose, mishandle, or have stolen associated Digital Currency private keys, or if your cosigners refuse to provide requisite authority, you acknowledge that you may not be able to recover associated Digital Currency, and that FrenchCoin is not responsible for such loss.</p>
            <p><strong>3.6. Customized FrenchCoin Payment Page.</strong> In some cases, you may establish a customizable payment page ("Payment Page") which will allow others to easily send Digital Currency to your FrenchCoin Account. You may establish and customize your Payment Page through your FrenchCoin Account settings, which will allow you to establish a user handle and associated Payments Page URL, upload a photo, and provide a short description. In establishing your Payment Page and uploading or adding any text, photo, or other material, you agree that you will not (<em>i</em>) post misleading materials or misappropriate the identity of another person or entity, (<em>ii</em>) post any copyrighted material which you are not authorized to post, or (<em>iii</em>) post any profane, unlawful, or offensive materials. FrenchCoin, in its sole discretion, may disable your Payment Page and take other action in accordance with this Agreement if we believe you are in violation of the foregoing or abusing this service. FrenchCoin may reclaim user handles associated with dormant FrenchCoin Accounts. FrenchCoin does not guarantee or endorse the purported identity, message, or other information posted by a user to the user's Payment Page.</p>
            <p><strong>3.7 Advanced Protocols.</strong> Unless specifically announced on our website or through some other official public statement of FrenchCoin, we do not support metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins which supplement or interact with a Digital Currency supported by FrenchCoin (collectively, “Advanced Protocols”). Do not use your FrenchCoin Account or GDAX account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction involving an Advanced Protocol. The FrenchCoin platform is not configured to detect and/or secure Advanced Protocol transactions and FrenchCoin assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect to Advanced Protocols.</p>
            <p><strong>3.8 Operation of Digital Currency Protocols.</strong> FrenchCoin does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. By using the FrenchCoin or GDAX platforms, you acknowledge and agree (i) that FrenchCoin is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that FrenchCoin makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Digital Currency you store in the FrenchCoin platform. In the event of a fork, you agree that FrenchCoin may temporarily suspend FrenchCoin operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that FrenchCoin may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that FrenchCoin assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.</p>
            <h2>4. Conversion Services.</h2>
            <p><strong>4.1. In General.</strong> Eligible users in certain jurisdictions may buy or sell supported Digital Currency through the Conversion Services. The Conversion Services are subject to the FrenchCoin "Conversion Rate" for the given transaction. "Conversion Rate" means the price of a given supported Digital Currency amount in terms of Fiat Currency or other Digital Currency as quoted on the FrenchCoin Site. The Conversion Rate is stated either as a "Buy Price" or as a "Sell Price," which is the price in terms of Fiat Currency or Digital Currency at which you may buy or sell supported Digital Currency to FrenchCoin. You acknowledge that the Buy Price Conversion Rate may not be the same as the Sell Price Conversion Rate at any given time, and that FrenchCoin may add a margin or “spread” to the quoted Conversion Rate. You agree, as a condition of using any FrenchCoin Conversion Services, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric. FrenchCoin reserves the right to delay any Conversion Service transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity. FrenchCoin does not guarantee the availability of its Conversion Service, and the act of purchasing supported Digital Currency from FrenchCoin does not result in a guarantee that you may sell your supported Digital Currency to FrenchCoin.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2. Purchase Transactions.</strong> After successfully completing the <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-2:-verification-procedures-and-limits">Verification Procedures</a>, you may purchase supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method. You authorize FrenchCoin to initiate debits from your selected payment method(s) in settlement of purchase transactions. A <strong>Conversion Fee</strong> (defined below) applies to all purchase transactions. Although FrenchCoin will attempt to deliver supported Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your selected payment method before Digital Currency is delivered to your FrenchCoin Account. We will make best efforts to fulfill all transactions, but in the rare circumstance where FrenchCoin cannot fulfill your purchase order, we will notify you and seek your approval to fulfill the purchase order at the contemporaneous Buy Price Conversion Rate. To secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement, you grant to FrenchCoin a lien on and security interest in and to the balances in your account.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3. Sale Transactions.</strong> After successfully completing the <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-2:-verification-procedures-and-limits">Verification Procedures</a>, you may sell supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method. You authorize FrenchCoin to debit your FrenchCoin Account(s) and initiate payments to your selected payment method(s) in settlement of sell transactions. An applicable Conversion Fee (defined below) applies to all sale transactions. Your receipt of funds will depend on the payment type, and may take up to three or more business days.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4. Conversion Fees.</strong> Each Conversion Service transaction is subject to a fee (a "Conversion Fee"). The applicable Conversion Fee is displayed to you on the FrenchCoin Site prior to you completing a Conversion Service transaction. FrenchCoin will not process a conversion transaction if the Conversion Fee and any other associated fees, such as wire transfer fees, would exceed the value of your transaction. Payments using other methods not described below, such as wire (if permitted), are subject to different transaction fees disclosed to you before you authorize the transaction.The availability of each Payment Method depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to your location, the identification information you have provided to us, and limitations imposed by third party payment processors.</p>
            <p>You can view the current fee applicable to your location and payment method at our <a href="https://support.frenchcoin.fr/customer/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees">Fees page</a>.</p>
            <p>FrenchCoin reserves the right to adjust its Conversion Fees and any applicable waivers at any time. We will always notify you of the Conversion Fee which applies to your transaction, both at the time of the transaction and in each receipt we issue to you.</p>
            <p><strong>4.5. Reversals; Cancellations.</strong> You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful or if your payment method has insufficient funds, you authorize FrenchCoin, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including FrenchCoin balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment provider. <strong>FrenchCoin reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases or sales of Digital Currency in its sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if FrenchCoin suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if FrenchCoin reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous; or if FrenchCoin suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, FrenchCoin will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>4.7. Payment Services Partners.</strong> FrenchCoin may use a third party payment processor to process any Fiat Currency payment between you and FrenchCoin, including but not limited to payments in relation to your use of the Conversion Service or deposits or withdrawals from your Currency Wallet or GDAX Account.</p>
            <h2>5. Currency Wallet.</h2>
            <p><strong>5.1. Currency Wallets.</strong> Certain approved users may establish and fund one or more Currency Wallets to facilitate transactions on the FrenchCoin or GDAX platforms. You are the owner of the balance of each of your Currency Wallets. FrenchCoin holds the balance of your Currency Wallets in dedicated custodial accounts with financial institutions. All funds held in a Currency Wallet are held on trust by FrenchCoin for the benefit of the user, or by a licensed Electronic Money Institution on behalf of the user.</p>
            <p><strong>5.2. Deposits and Withdrawals.</strong> You may initiate a transfer from your linked bank account to fund a Currency Wallet. Fees may apply to deposits and withdrawals from your Currency Wallet. All fees will be clearly disclosed in your FrenchCoin account and at <a href="https://support.frenchcoin.fr/customer/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees">https://support.frenchcoin.fr/customer/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees</a>.</p>
            <p>For deposits, FrenchCoin will credit your Currency Wallet a corresponding amount of Fiat Currency after funds are delivered to FrenchCoin, typically within two to three business days after you authorize a deposit. For withdrawals, FrenchCoin will immediately debit your Currency Wallet when you authorize a withdrawal and funds will typically settle to you within two to three business days. Bank fees are netted out of transfers to or from FrenchCoin. We will not process a transfer if associated bank fees exceed the value of the transfer.</p>
            <h2>6. General Use, Prohibited Use, and Termination.</h2>
            <p><strong>6.1. Limited License.</strong> We grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to access and use the FrenchCoin Site, and related content, materials, information (collectively, the "Content") solely for approved purposes as permitted by FrenchCoin from time to time.

            <p><strong>6.3. Third-Party Applications.</strong> If, to the extent permitted by FrenchCoin from time to time, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your FrenchCoin Account, either through the third party's product or service or through the FrenchCoin Site, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your FrenchCoin Account. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold FrenchCoin responsible for, and will indemnify FrenchCoin from, any liability arising out of or related to any act or omission of any third party with access to your FrenchCoin Account. You may change or remove permissions granted by you to third parties with respect to your FrenchCoin Account at any time through the Account Settings (Integrations) page on the FrenchCoin Site.</p>
            <p><strong>6.4. Prohibited Use.</strong> In connection with your use of the FrenchCoin Services, and your interactions with other users, and third parties you agree and represent you will not engage in any <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Prohibited Business or Prohibited Use</a> defined herein. We reserve the right at all times to monitor, review, retain and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, sanctions programs, legal process or governmental request. We reserve the right to cancel and/or suspend your FrenchCoin Account and/or block transactions or freeze funds immediately and without notice if we determine, in our sole discretion, that your Account is associated with a Prohibited Use and/or a Prohibited Business.</p>
            <p><strong>6.5. Export Controls &amp; Sanctions.</strong> Your use of the FrenchCoin Services and the FrenchCoin Site is subject to international export controls and economic sanctions requirements. By sending, receiving, buying, selling, trading or storing Digital Currency through the FrenchCoin Site or FrenchCoin Services, you represent and warrant that you will comport with those requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not acquire Digital Currency or use any of the FrenchCoin Services through the FrenchCoin Site if: (1) you are in, under the control of, or a national or resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria or any other country subject to United States embargo, UN sanctions, HM Treasury's financial sanctions regime, or if you are on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Unverified List, Entity List HM Treasury's financial sanctions regime; or (2) you intend to supply any acquired or stored Digital Currency or FrenchCoin Services to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria or any other country subject to United States embargo or HM Treasury's financial sanctions regime (or a national or resident of one of these countries), or to a person on the Specially Designated Nationals List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, Entity List, or HM Treasury's financial sanctions regime.</p>
            <p><strong>6.6. Transactions Limits</strong>. The use of all FrenchCoin Services is subject to a limit on the amount of volume, stated in Fiat Currency terms, you may transact or transfer in a given period (e.g., daily). To view your limits, login to your FrenchCoin Account and visit <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/verifications">https://www.frenchcoin.fr/verifications</a>. Your transaction limits may vary depending on your payment method, verification steps you have completed, and other factors. FrenchCoin reserves the right to change applicable limits as we deem necessary in our sole discretion. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted amounts, you may submit a request at <a href="https://support.frenchcoin.fr">https://support.frenchcoin.fr</a>. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with FrenchCoin staff (such process, "Enhanced Due Diligence"). FrenchCoin reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with Enhanced Due Diligence, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.</p>
            <p><strong>6.7. Suspension, Termination, and Cancellation.</strong> FrenchCoin may: (a) suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the FrenchCoin Services, and/or (b) deactivate or cancel your FrenchCoin Account if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We are so required by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of a government authority; <em>or</em></li>
              <li>We reasonably suspect you of using your FrenchCoin Account in connection with a <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Prohibited</a> <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Use or</a> <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Business</a>; <em>or</em></li>
              <li>Use of your FrenchCoin Account is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your Account activity; <em>or</em></li>
              <li>Our service partners are unable to support your use; <em>or</em></li>
              <li>You take any action that FrenchCoin deems as circumventing FrenchCoin's controls, including, but not limited to, opening multiple FrenchCoin Accounts or abusing promotions which FrenchCoin may offer from time to time.</li>
              <li>You breach our <a href="https://support.frenchcoin.fr/customer/portal/articles/2704120">Behavior Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If FrenchCoin suspends or closes your account, or terminates your use of FrenchCoin Services for any reason, we will provide you with notice of our actions unless a court order or other legal process prohibits FrenchCoin from providing you with such notice. You acknowledge that FrenchCoin's decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your account, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to FrenchCoin's risk management and security protocols. You agree that FrenchCoin is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you.</p>

Merchant Services.</strong> Users who intend to sell goods and/or services (each, a "Merchant") and who wish to accept Digital Currency from purchasers as a method of payment may use a suite of tools and related services for this purpose (the "Merchant Services"). Through the Merchant Services, FrenchCoin enables Merchants to accept Digital Currency from customers as a method of payment, and processes the transfer of Digital Currency to Merchants from their customers. Merchants may also sell Digital Currency to, or buy Digital Currency from, FrenchCoin, and otherwise utilize the FrenchCoin Services, in the same manner as any other user. Use of Merchant Services is subject to this Part 2 and is also subject to General Use terms, including without limitation the releases, indemnities, disclaimers, limitations of liability, prohibited use, dispute resolution, and cancellation policies set forth above.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2. Merchant Profile.</strong> Each Merchant user is required to provide accurate information necessary to complete a merchant profile associated with the user's FrenchCoin Account. This information may include business name, address and other contact information, website URL, taxpayer or other government ID, corporate documents, and other information FrenchCoin may request. FrenchCoin may limit Merchant transaction volumes depending on (<em>i</em>) the Merchant's historical activity on FrenchCoin, (<em>ii</em>) satisfactory completion of a Merchant profile; (<em>iii</em>) satisfaction of reasonable requests for additional information; (<em>iv</em>) perceived risks; (<em>v</em>) repeated customer complaints; and/or (<em>vi</em>) any indication that the Merchant has violated this Agreement. Newly on-boarded Merchants may be required to submit to additional verification procedures as necessary to verify that the Merchant operates a legitimate business.</p>
            <h2>2. Merchant Transactions and Settlement.</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1. Transaction Confirmation.</strong> FrenchCoin will provide users of Merchant Services with an order notification indicating when or whether the Merchant has been paid by its customer.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2. Completed Order Notifications.</strong> Upon Merchant's customer's submission of a valid and completed payment through Merchant Services, FrenchCoin will send a callback to Merchant's designated callback URL to confirm successful transfer of the customer's payment to Merchant—so designated as a "completed" order. Except on suspicion of fraud, error, or abusive use, FrenchCoin will not reverse a payment and/or corresponding Digital Currency credit which it has designated as completed.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3. Timing of Completed Order.</strong> If the Merchant's customer uses a Hosted Digital Currency Wallet to successfully initiate its purchase, FrenchCoin will issue the completed callback order immediately to the Merchant. If the Merchant's customer does not use a Hosted Digital Currency Wallet to effect its purchase, FrenchCoin will initiate an order status callback when FrenchCoin detects that the corresponding Digital Currency transaction has been confirmed by the corresponding Digital Currency network.</p>
            <p><strong>2.4. Mispaid Order Notifications.</strong> A callback may also indicate an order status as "mispaid," meaning FrenchCoin has detected transfer of an amount of Digital Currency which does not correspond with the Digital Currency Price and/or that the customer transferred Digital Currency after expiration of a checkout window. "Mispaid" orders may result in transfer of Digital Currency to Merchant's FrenchCoin Wallet for further processing by Merchant in accordance with Merchant's refund and order processing policies, but shall not be deemed completed by FrenchCoin.</p>
            <p><strong>2.5 Limitations.</strong> FrenchCoin may delay order verifications if Merchant has not provided its legal name, logo, website, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, designation of business location and type. Until completion of such applicable verification procedures, newly-boarded Merchants may experience delayed processing of Digital Currency Transactions or Conversion Service transactions. FrenchCoin will designate any such delayed transaction as "pending," and funds will not be available in the Merchant's FrenchCoin Account and/or Currency Account until the pending transaction is completed. FrenchCoin reserves the right to refuse to process, cancel, or to reverse any Merchant transaction (<em>i</em>) as required by law, (<em>ii</em>) in response to a facially valid subpoena, court order, or other government order, or (<em>iii</em>) if FrenchCoin reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous, or related to <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business</a> as defined in the User Agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>2.6. Instant Conversion.</strong> Merchants who have successfully linked a payout method to their FrenchCoin Account may use the Instant Conversion Service. The Instant Conversion Service will allow Merchants to designate the price of their goods and services in Fiat Currency and customers to pay for their purchases from such Merchant in Digital Currency based on the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted by FrenchCoin on the FrenchCoin Site and displayed to the customer at the time that the customer approves the purchase. In connection with the Instant Conversion Service, the Merchant, as merchant of record for each transaction, shall: (<em>i</em>) use FrenchCoin to calculate an appropriate amount of Digital Currency (a "Digital Currency Price") to be transferred to Merchant as payment for a good or service with reference to the Sell Price Conversion Rate at the time Merchant's customer visits the Merchant's checkout page; FrenchCoin will lock the Digital Currency Price for a period of time, but if the customer does not initiate a transfer within a certain payment window, FrenchCoin will recalculate the Digital Currency Price based on an updated Sell Price Conversion Rate; (<em>ii</em>) accept Digital Currency into its corresponding Hosted Digital Currency Wallet; (<em>iii</em>) immediately sell such Digital Currency to FrenchCoin using the Instant Conversion Service, and (<em>iv</em>) subsequently receive the proceeds from such Digital Currency sale transaction from FrenchCoin in the relevant Fiat Currency in an amount equal to the original price of the item in the applicable Fiat Currency, less applicable fees. By using this service, FrenchCoin guarantees that regardless of any change in the price of Digital Currency between the time of purchase and settlement, the Merchant will receive the fixed purchase price as designated by the Merchant in Fiat Currency at the time the customer approved the purchase, less applicable fees.</p>
            <p><strong>2.7 Settlement.</strong> Settlements to Merchant in connection with the Merchant's sale of Digital Currency to FrenchCoin will generally take a minimum of two to three business days, following FrenchCoin's transmission to Merchant of confirmation of the relevant transaction, although exceptions may apply.</p>
            <h2>3. Release, Restrictions, and General Use.</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1 Merchant Transactions.</strong> Each Merchant acknowledges and agrees that FrenchCoin has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that the Merchant may sell to customers using the FrenchCoin Services. Each Merchant is responsible for handling customer inquiries related to the goods and/or services it sells to customers through the FrenchCoin Services, except for inquiries related to payment for such goods or services which will be handled by FrenchCoin. Each Merchant warrants that it will not use any FrenchCoin Services in connection with any <a href="https://www.frenchcoin.fr/legal/user_agreement#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Prohibited Use or Business</a>, as described herein. Each Merchant confirms that by opening a FrenchCoin Account, the Merchant will not use the FrenchCoin Services to accept payments in connection with any of the Prohibited Businesses. Each Merchant further warrants that it will not use FrenchCoin Services in connection with transactions which involve pre-payment of an order which the Merchant does not intend to fulfill within thirty (30) days. When a Merchant must issue a refund to a customer, FrenchCoin will debit the Merchant's Hosted Digital Currency Wallet for the relevant amount of Digital Currency (or, in the event the Merchant uses the Instant Conversion Service, the Merchant shall purchase the relevant amount of Digital Currency in Fiat Currency before Digital Currency is debited from the Merchant's Hosted Digital Currency Wallet) and provide a refund to the customer in Digital Currency having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in Fiat Currency, based on the then current Conversion Rate.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2. Obligations of Merchants.</strong> In addition to the obligations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Merchants agree to:</p>
            <p>(a) At all times maintain all licenses, registrations, authorizations and approvals required to operate their business, conduct all activities related thereto, and utilize the FrenchCoin Services in connection therewith.</p>
            <p>(b) Ensure that all aspects of their business, including (i) all Merchant activities, and the activity of any third party engaged by the Merchant, (ii) the goods and services offered for sale by Merchant, and (iii) the acts or omissions of each Merchant in connection with their use of FrenchCoin Services comply with applicable law at all times.</p>
            <p>(c) Promptly provide, and cause third parties under its control to promptly provide, such information as FrenchCoin may request from time to time regarding (i) the Merchant, its policies, procedures, and activities, (ii) any good or service offered for sale and for which the Merchant may accept payment by use of FrenchCoin Services, or (iii) any transaction conducted through the use of FrenchCoin Services, to the extent FrenchCoin deems such information reasonably necessary to comply with its policies or procedures, applicable law, an audit, or the guidance or direction of, or request from, any regulatory authority or financial institution.</p>
            <p>(d) Within the FrenchCoin-hosted payment page, accurately identity the sale item in the Item Name field and provide an accurate and succinct description of the same sale item in the Item Description Field.</p>
            <p>(e) Authorize FrenchCoin to, directly or through third parties, (<em>i</em>) make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or account information, and (<em>ii</em>) request and obtain any consumer report, credit report or similar information relating to you and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports, and hereby authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.</p>

In the event your systems or infrastructure that are used for storage, processing or hosting Customer Data are breached or compromised, or if Customer Data is inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify FrenchCoin promptly of such a breach or exposure including root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future. You are responsible for providing customer notification under the state breach notification statutes and any other applicable privacy laws and you will bear the costs incurred by FrenchCoin resulting from your breach or exposure. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any personal injury or property damage arising from or relating to your use of any Developer's Tools or any authorized or unauthorized use of your Application.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for obtaining all required consents from end users in connection with any use of your Application and the Developer's Tools, which consent shall be compliant with all applicable data protection legislation and other privacy laws, rules, and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting any Customer Data or other information from end users of your Application, you must provide adequate notice of what Customer Data and other information you collect and how it will be used and/or shared and obtain any necessary consents.

If a user requests of you or FrenchCoin to have any Customer Data that may be considered PII under any law, rule, or regulation throughout the world deleted, you agree to promptly honor the user's or FrenchCoin's request and to delete all such data and information from your servers and other assets, including back-ups, to the extent reasonably possible, or to anonymize all user data so it cannot be tied back to a user's identity.</p>
            <p><strong>6.3. Data Use.</strong> You will not sell any Customer Data or disclose any Customer Data to any third party. Your Application may use Customer Data only as required for use and access to your Application by the end user to whom such Customer Data relates.

Any use of Customer Data other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.</p>
